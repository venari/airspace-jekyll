              <h2>DotNet Core FullStack development</h2>
              <h4>C#, Docker, React, Redux, Oh My!</h4>
              <p>
                Our default go-to development platform; efficient, cross-platform, and swift to develop with,
                using ether SQL Server, MongoDB or SQLite as our persistence layer.

              <p>
                From enterprise level spatial analysis and visualisation to consumer grade web maps,

              <h2>Embedded systems development</h2>
              <h4>Containerised front ends on embedded platforms</h4>
              <p>
                Only a few years ago, embedded software development was very tricky and low level.
                Using modern software development practices including Docker, C#, Node.JS, and AngluarJS/ReactJS,
                Venari has experience targeting system-on-a-chip platforms like the Raspberry Pi Zero
                to interact with low level realtime systems and provide improved end-user experiences
                and realtime visualisation of the systems state.
              </p>
