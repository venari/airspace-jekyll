A short 35 second video - and it only took 10 months to make!

I've been testing a proof of concept for multi-month drone hyper-lapse video of construction projects in Porirua - the test is only half complete as the construction projects have not been completed, but already the orbital approach appears to work better than the linear one as it's easier to align the different captures. Despite the fact the drone can position itself to within a couple of metres each time, the slightest difference can introduce all kinds of wonky looking parallax issues.

The video below is draft as the construction projects are not complete, but illustrates the concept:
